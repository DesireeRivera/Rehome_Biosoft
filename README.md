### Project Description ###
Telecare application aimed at patients who need or are undergoing any type of rehabilitation. This application contains different types of exercises with their respective levels of difficulty. 
Biomechanical reports of these exercises will be made thanks to the data obtained in two possible ways: a sensorization system or a video detection platform with markers. 
Thanks to these reports it will be possible to see the evolution of the patient. In addition, a robotic system has been developed that allows simulating the exercise performed.
